# Homura - Yet another Discord bot

Homura is a personal Discord bot that I've decided to open source and try to make serious for the general public.

## Features
* Logging of user events to database
* Undeletion of messages in channels for admins
* Booru image searching
* ~~Semi~~ working implementation of a NSFL filter
* Spaghetti code

## TODO
* Complete the web interface for the server events
* Complete the backend service for image determination
* Unit testing?

## Deployment
#### FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK FROM SCRATCH

## Thanks
Thanks goes to the many bot devs that have published their projects on GitHub for great examples on how to solve problems.
* discord.py (Rapptz)
* MusicBot (Rhino)
* Mee6 (Cookie)
* ???? (Zephy) **lol**
